summary: We discuss Exclusion Stability for the Voter Model.
abstract: The notions of noise sensitivity and stability were recently extended for the voter model, a well-known and studied interactive particle system. In this model, vertices of a graph have opinions that are updated by uniformly selecting edges. We further extend stability results to a different class of perturbations when the nearest neighbor exclusion process is performed in the collection of edge selections. Under a rate depending on the underlying graph, we prove that the consensus opinion of the voter model is exclusion stable when the dynamics above run for a short amount of time. This is done by analyzing the expected size of the pivotal set.
