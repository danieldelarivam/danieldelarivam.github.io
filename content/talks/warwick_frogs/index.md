summary: The phase transitions in the frog model.
abstract: The frog model is an interacting particle system, where particles are of type A (asleep) until hit by a particle of type B. Despite the simplicity of the definition, many questions remain open. We prove existence and sharpness of the phase transition for the frog model on transitive graphs of either polynomial growth, or non-amenable. Joint seminar with Omer Angel.
